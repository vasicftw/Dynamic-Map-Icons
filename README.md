<b>ABOUT</b>

This system presents small icons from singleplayer on mini-map (radar). Original version of this filterscript is on Serbian language. 
I've already released it to SA-MP Forum - https://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=667860 

<b>HOW TO INSTALL</b>
    
In order for the system to work comfortably for you, you need to adapt the script to your gamemode. You will also need a <i> MapIcons </i> folder in scriptfiles.
 
<b>CONFIGURATIONS</b>

<code>#define MAX_MAPICONS    150 // '150' is the max number of map icons (limit), you can change it.</code>

<b>HAVE FUN!</b>
